------------

```sh

You can quickly install Cairo and its dependencies for OS X using the one liner below:

```sh
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LearnBoost/node-canvas/master/install -O - | sh
```

or if you use MacPorts:

```sh
sudo port install pkgconfig libpng giflib freetype libpixman cairo
```

Run local server:

```sh
$ npm start
```

Run mocha (server) and jasmine (client) unit tests:
```sh
$ grunt test
```

Tests and minifies current javascripts and generate yuidocs
```sh
$ grunt build
```

Initiate Vagrant box for sharing
```sh
$ vagrant up
```
